Changes in SecureCRT 6.1.2 (Official) -- November 6, 2008
---------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - SSH2: In the session .INI file, if the GEX Preferred Size was
    set to 2046, it will be changed to 2048 in order to be compatible
    with Cisco IOS 12.4 or later.

Bug fixes:

  - If a script was specified on the command line, SecureCRT was
    in a hung state after the script executed.
  - With ANSI color enabled, if a color escape sequence was
    received, only the portion of the row that contained characters
    was correctly displayed.
  - SSH2: In an SFTP tab, if the connection was lost and a put
    command was issued, SecureCRT crashed.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.1.1 (Official) -- October 2, 2008
--------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If the auto-reconnect option was set for a session and the
    connection was lost, an error dialog was displayed.  The 5.5
    behavior of not displaying a dialog was restored.
  - If the session option "Display logon prompts in terminal window"
    was not set and a logon script was specified, the script was
    started before the connection was established.  The 6.0 behavior
    of starting the script after the connection is established was
    restored.
  - Logon scripts were run when the administrative option to disallow
    scripts from being run in SecureCRT was set.
  - If the global option "Show confirm disconnect dialog" was set and
    multiple sessions were open in different windows, exiting the
    Activator could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - SecureCRT crashed when cancelling out of the select log file
    dialog if the session tab no longer existed.
  - In the Connect dialog, doing a Find Next after deleting a session
    that had been found using Find caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - In the Global Options dialog, on the Firewall page, double-
    clicking the empty space below the firewall list or pressing the
    DEL key when no firewall was selected caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - After answering "No" to the confirm disconnect dialog, SecureCRT
    became unresponsive.
  - Under certain circumstances, if there were multiple SecureCRT
    windows and the menu bar was toggled, SecureCRT could become
    unresponsive.
  - After selecting text in the scrollback buffer using a triple- 
    click, it was no longer possible to select text in the scrollback
    buffer.
  - If the SecureCRT window was maximized after scrolling up, garbage
    was displayed in the session window.
  - If an "exit" command was sent to a session in a script and then
    another connection was immediately attempted, it could cause the
    script to hang.
  - If a session was connected using the Session.Connect(/s <session>)
    scripting method, the initial position specified in the session
    options was not honored.
  - SSH2: The TCP connection associated with a dynamic port forward
    could get stuck in a CLOSE_WAIT state after the session was
    disconnected.
  - SSH2: Under certain circumstances, dynamic port forwarding was not
    started when a session was connected.
  - SSH1/SSH2: If the session option "Start log upon connect" was set
    and no log file was specified, when connecting to the session,
    after entering the password, focus went to the session window
    instead of the Select Log File dialog.
  - Global Secure Shell configuration information was not being
    migrated.
  - If two sessions had the same name, hostname, and username, they
    were combined during migration, but only the terminal protocol
    was set.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.1 (Official) -- August 21, 2008
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Under certain circumstances, SecureCRT could not write log files
    to a mapped drive.
  - Under certain circumstances, when Quick Connect was used to make
    multiple connections, the authentication dialog was associated 
    with the initial session window.
  - If nothing had previously been typed into the session window,
    pressing ALT+<numeral> sent the number to the session rather than
    switching to the specified tab.
  - When Windows was configured to use large fonts (120 DPI), some 
    text in the Session Options dialog did not fit in the dialog.
  - If a URL that spanned multiple lines had extra spaces at the end
    of a line, the extra spaces were not removed when the URL was
    opened.
  - Serial: After a serial session was disconnected, the tab connec-
    tion status indicator was not updated to reflect that the session
    had been disconnected.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.1 (Beta 4) -- July 31, 2008
--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - SSH2: Because of a limitation in some recent versions of Cisco's
    IOS which resulted in SecureCRT not being able to connect, the
    diffie-hellman-group-exchange key exchange algorithm was modified
    to send a different maximum size for the modulus.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when running a script that attempted to connect
    to multiple sessions.
  - Calling Config.GetOption("Password") in a script caused SecureCRT
    to crash.
  - After calling the script Session object method Connect, execution
    of the script continued regardless of whether or not
    authentication had completed.
  - When the global option "CTRL+TAB switches to most recently used
    tab" was set, pressing CTRL+TAB cycled between all the tabs
    rather than going to the most recently used tab.
  - Under certain circumstances, launching SecureCRT caused
    MFC80U.dll errors to be reported in the Windows Event Viewer.
  - Serial: After sending CTRL+C to a serial device, SecureCRT hung.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.1 (Beta 3) -- July 17, 2008
--------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - Under Windows 2000, a KERNEL32.dll error was reported when
    SecureCRT started.
  - SecureCRT crashed when the Script menu option was selected if
    the Recent Script list contained at least six items.
  - Leading spaces were removed when copied from the terminal
    window to the clipboard.
  - When a second session was started in a new maximized window,
    the logon prompt was displayed part way down the screen.
  - Under certain circumstances, if SecureCRT was started and then
    maximized, the logon prompt was not visible.
  - When custom log data was specified, long lines were wrapped in
    the log file.
  - If a session was reconnected while minimized and then it was
    restored, the size would be different.
  - The Activator used a different configuration folder than
    SecureCRT when SecureCRT specified the /F command-line option.
  - When the custom menu (.MNU) option MENU_TAB_LIST1 was used, the
    menu did not display the list of tabbed sessions.
  - RLogin: SecureCRT could crash when an RLogin session was
    disconnected.
  - TAPI: SecureCRT crashed when the remote host was VMS and the
    session was disconnected by logging off the host machine.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.1 (Beta 2) -- July 2, 2008
-------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If SecureCRT was running during an upgrade install, the installer
    continued to report that a file was in use after SecureCRT was
    closed and Retry was selected.
  - The installer did not handle the answer file option
    INSTALLATION_PROFILE.
  - SSH1: If a command that resulted in a lot of output was run,
    pressing CTRL+C could cause the session to become unresponsive.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.1 (Beta 1) -- June 19, 2008
--------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added the ability to search sessions and folders in the Connect
    dialog, which supports searching for a session name, hostname,
    folder name, or a keyword in the description.
  - Added items to the File menu to reconnect all disconnected
    sessions and disconnect all connected sessions.
  - Added support for an unlimited number of automated logon
    Expect/Send sequences and the ability to delete and reorder
    the sequences.
  - Several example VB scripts are installed, which demonstrate how
    to use SecureCRT's scripting support.
  - Added scripting support for sending special keys such as
    function keys, control keys, and other special characters,
    which makes it easier to write scripts that are protocol
    and emulation independent.
  - Added Clipboard scripting functions provide access to the
    current selected text and also to available Clipboard data,
    which allows setting up actions such as running a script
    that uses the contents of the Clipboard to send a command
    to the session, or selecting text in the session and running
    a script which launches a web browser to google that text.
  - Added scripting support for accessing session options, which
    makes it possible to do operations such as configuring a session
    before connecting and converting session information stored in a
    file to saved sessions.
  - Added error handling methods to the Application scripting
    object.  The new methods GetLastError and GetLastErrorMessage
    provide flexibility to how errors are handled in scripts.
  - The script method Connect can be called without arguments in
    order to reconnect a session.
  - SSH1/SSH2: Added an option for authentication credentials to be
    entered in the terminal window, which allows Secure Shell logons
    to be scripted using the Expect/Send strings or "Logon script"
    option found in the Session Options dialog.
  - SSH1/SSH2: The username and password can be saved when using
    keyboard-interactive authentication, streamlining the logon
    process.
  - SSH1/SSH2: Added a session option to execute a remote command
    after connecting.
  - SFTP: Added a "view" command which downloads the specified file
    and opens it in the default editor or appropriate application.
  - SFTP: If the remote server is VShell for Windows 3.5 or later,
    there is a "su" command in the SFTP tab that allows you to
    become a different user.

Changes:

  - When the "Single Instance" and "Launch New Windows in a
    Separate Process" options are set, sessions cannot be opened in
    a separate window.
  - The serial port can now be changed in the Default session.
  - Added read access to the crt.FileTransfer.ZmodemUploadAscii
    property.
  - SSH2: The option "Enable OpenSSH agent forwarding" can be
    specified on a per-session basis.

Bug fixes:

  - When the session option "Retain size and font" was set, if
    the window was resized to be smaller than the number of
    logical rows, it was not possible to scroll to the rows that
    were cut off.
  - If a session was maximized and the "Synchronize view to size"
    option was set, if the session was sent to a new window, the
    logical rows and columns in the new window were incorrect. 
  - Unicode output was not displayed correctly in a tabbed session
    other than the first tab.
  - Under certain circumstances with SecureCRT maximized, text
    could be cut off when switching between tabbed sessions.
  - Opening a new window while in full screen mode caused the new
    window to appear partially off screen.
  - Under certain circumstances, a second SecureCRT window for an
    existing session was cascaded when it shouldn't have been.
  - If two sessions with different initial positions were connected,
    only the initial position for the first session was honored.
  - If the "Auto reconnect" option was set and authentication was
    cancelled by the user, the session attempted to auto reconnect.
  - Under certain circumstances when the "Auto reconnect" option
    was enabled, a session attempted to reconnect even though its
    associated tab had been closed.
  - When the "Save expanded folder state in connect dialog" option
    was set and a session in a folder was renamed in the Connect
    dialog, it caused other folders to be expanded.
  - It was not possible to map a key or button to "Trace Options"
    or "Raw Log Session".
  - The recent scripts menu item MENU_SCRIPT_MRU_FILE1 did not work
    when used in a custom .MNU file.
  - In a script, certain crt.Screen.ReadString syntax errors could
    result in a crash.
  - In a script, if a Connect call was made immediately after a
    Disconnect call, SecureCRT could think the session was not
    connected.
  - Under certain circumstances, the line number reported when a
    script was cancelled was incorrect.
  - Paste output did not continue if a WaitForStrings script method
    matched something in the pasted text.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT could crash when web traffic was forwarded
    through Firefox's Foxy-Proxy.
  - SSH2: When a certificate from a CAPI store was used to
    authenticate, agent forwarding did not work.
  - SFTP: On some platforms, such as rhel5 and rhel4-64, wildcard
    (ls -l *) file listings were returned in the wrong order.
  - U3: Configuration settings were uninstalled when the U3 version
    was uninstalled.
